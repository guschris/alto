Your objective is to generate a comprehensive breakdown of the conversation history, prioritizing the user's explicit instructions, prior interactions, and technical details critical for maintaining continuity in development workflows. This breakdown must meticulously preserve technical elements, coding patterns, and architectural choices.

Before delivering your final output, enclose your evaluation in `<analysis>` tags to systematically structure your review process. During your evaluation:  

1. Sequentially evaluate each message and conversation segment. For every segment, explicitly clarify:  
   - The user's defined goals and explicit instructions  
   - Your chosen strategy to fulfill these instructions  
   - Crucial decisions, technical terminology, and coding paradigms  
   - Specifics such as file paths, complete implementations, function definitions, or line-by-line modifications  

2. Validate technical precision and completeness, ensuring all required components are rigorously addressed.

Include these mandatory sections in your output:

1. **Core Requirements and Objectives**:  
   Exhaustively document all explicit requirements and objectives mentioned by the user.

2. **Key Technical Terminology**:  
   - [Technology/Framework 1]  
   - [Technology/Framework 2]  
   - [...]  

3. **Files and Implementation Segments**:  
   - **[File Name 1]**  
     - Summary of its relevance to the project  
     - Modifications made and their technical rationale  
     - [Critical Code Snippet]  
   - **[File Name 2]**  
     - [Relevant Code Segment]  
   - [...]  

4. **Resolution Analysis**:  
   Document resolved issues and active diagnostic efforts.  

5. **Outstanding Assignments**:  
   - [Task 1]  
   - [Task 2]  
   - [...]  

6. **Active Development Focus**:  
   Provide a detailed account of work in progress prior to this summary request, including precise file references and code extracts where applicable.  

7. **Strategic Next Phase (Optional)**:  
   Propose an action item aligned directly with the user's confirmed objectives and recent workflows. **Critical**: Ensure this phase is an exact extension of the user’s explicit request. Avoid initiating unrelated tasks without user validation.  

8. **Contextual Evidence (if applicable)**:  
   If suggesting a next step, cite verbatim quotes from the conversation’s final exchanges to anchor your reasoning to the exact task context.

   - [...]  

3. **Files and Implementation Segments**:  
   - **[File Path 1]**  
     - Purpose: [...]  
     - Changes: [...]  
     - ```[Language]  
       [Code snippet]  
       ```  
   - [...]  

4. **Resolution Analysis**:  
   [Description of resolved bottlenecks and active challenges]  

5. **Outstanding Assignments**:  
   - [Task 1]  
   - [...]  

6. **Active Development Focus**:  
   [Detailed explanation of ongoing work]  

7. **Strategic Next Phase**:  
   [Targeted action item]  

8. **Contextual Evidence**:  
   "[User’s exact instruction]: [Verbatim text]"  
   "[Assistant’s response]: [Verbatim text]"  
</summary>  
</example>  

Structure your response according to the above guidelines, emphasizing precision, technical rigor, and verbatim adherence to the user’s original directive.
